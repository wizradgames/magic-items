  {"name": "Deck Of Wonder", "type": "Wondrous Item", "rarity": "Uncommon", "attunement": "-", "description": "Created in the image of the Deck of Many Things, this deck of ivory or vellum cards bestows an assortment of minor benefits and penalties on those who draw from it. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw, then draw them randomly. Any additional cards drawn have no effect. Unless a card states otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.\n\nUnless it is the Mystery card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.\n\nYou can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck, as shown in the Deck of Wonder table below.\n\nBeginning.\nYour hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 2d10. Your hit point maximum remains increased in this way for the next 8 hours.\n\nChampion.\nYou gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack and damage rolls. This bonus lasts for 8 hours.\n\nChancellor*.\nWithin 8 hours of drawing this card, you can cast Augury once as an action, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nChaos.\nYou gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. This resistance lasts for 1d12 days.\n\nCoin*.\nFive pieces of jewelry, each worth 100 gp, or ten gemstones, each worth 50 gp, appear at your feet.\n\nCrown.\nYou learn the Friends cantrip. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). If you already know this cantrip, the card has no effect.\n\nDawn.\nThis card invigorates you. For the next 8 hours, you can add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls.\n\nDay.\nYou gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.\n\nDestiny*.\nThis card protects you against an untimely demise. The first time after drawing this card that you would drop to 0 hit points from taking damage, you instead drop to 1 hit point.\n\nDusk*.\nThis card supernaturally saps your energy. You have disadvantage on initiative rolls. This effect lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.\n\nEnd.\nThis card is an omen of death. You take 2d10 necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This effect can’t reduce your hit point maximum below 10 hit points. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.\n\nIsolation*.\nYou disappear, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, and become trapped in a harmless extradimensional space for 1d4 minutes. You draw no more cards. You then reappear in the space you left or the nearest unoccupied space. When you reappear, you must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition for 1 hour as your body reels from the extradimensional travel.\n\nJustice*.\nYou momentarily gain the ability to balance the scales of fate. For the next 8 hours, whenever you or a creature within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.\n\nKnife.\nAn uncommon magic weapon you’re proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.\n\nLock.\nYou gain the ability to cast Knock 1d3 times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nMischief.\nYou receive an uncommon wondrous item (chosen by the DM), or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\nMonster.\nThis card’s monstrous visage curses you. While cursed in this way, whenever you make a saving throw, you must roll 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from the total. The curse lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early with a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.\n\nMystery*.\nYou have disadvantage on Intelligence saving throws for 1 hour. Discard this card and draw from the deck again; together, the two draws count as one of your declared draws.\n\nNight.\nYou gain darkvision within a range of 300 feet. This darkvision lasts for 8 hours.\n\nOrder.\nYou gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): force, necrotic, poison, psychic, or radiant. This resistance lasts for 1d12 days.\n\nStudent*.\nYou gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).\n\nVulture*.\nOne nonmagical item or piece of equipment in your possession (chosen by the DM) disappears. The item remains nearby but concealed for a short time, so it can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the item isn’t recovered within 1 hour, it disappears forever.\n\nSource: The Book of Many Things", "tables": [{"title": "Deck of Wonder", "rows": ["Card|Card Title","Ace of Diamonds|Chancellor*","King of Diamonds|Day","Queen of Diamonds|Night","Jack of Diamonds|Dawn","2 of Diamonds|Dusk*","Ace of Hearts|Destiny*","King of Hearts|Crown","Queen of Hearts|Lock","Jack of Hearts|Champion","2 of Hearts|Coin*","Ace of Clubs|Vulture","King of Clubs|Chaos","Queen of Clubs|Order","Jack of Clubs|Beginning","2 of Clubs|Mystery*","Ace of Spades|Isolation*","King of Spades|End","Queen of Spades|Monster","Jack of Spades|Knife","2 of Spades|Justice*","Joker (with tm)|Student*","Joker (without tm)|Mischief","*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards.| "]}]},
